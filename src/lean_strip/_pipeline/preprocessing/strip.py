"""Pure source-text planning for module- and declaration-level stripping.

Given a Lean source file's text and the declaration ranges emitted by the
`.olean` declaration reader (see preprocessing/olean.py), `strip_source` removes
the source spans of every declaration NOT in the keep-set, leaving all
non-declaration scaffolding (imports, `open`, `namespace`/`end`, `variable`,
`notation`/`macro`, free-floating comments) untouched.

Everything here is pure text -> text. engine.py owns all I/O: it builds the
project, writes the planned sources back, and certifies the result with the
final builds.

Key facts about the ranges (verified empirically against the pinned toolchains):
  * Line numbers are 1-based; the command range is [start_line, end_line]
    inclusive.
  * The range INCLUDES a leading docstring (`/-- ... -/`), so deleting a
    dropped decl's span removes its docstring too — no orphans.
  * A standalone `@[attr]` line ABOVE the keyword is NOT part of the range, so
    we extend a deletion upward over such lines.
  * Range-less decls (auto-generated `.rec`/`.ctor`/`.match_n`/...) carry
    start_line is None and are never deleted (they have no source).
